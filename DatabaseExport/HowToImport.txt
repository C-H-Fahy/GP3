Note to teammates:
Database Exports are in DatabaseExport
To import a Database go to phpmyadmin(normally http://127.0.0.1:8080/phpmyadmin) go to the import tab then select the database you want import

You may want to drop all tables before importing this can be done in the Structure tab by pressing the "Drop" button
(unfortunately EasyPHP disables drop database)
